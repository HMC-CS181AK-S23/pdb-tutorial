Your boss has given you the following project to fix for a client. It's supposed
to be a simple dice game, where the object of the game is to correctly add up
the values of the dice for 6 consecutive turns.

The issue is that a former programmer worked on it who didn't know how to debug
effectively. It's now up to you to clean up this code and add tests. After
running main.py, answer the questions below.

What behaviors do you want to test? List at least three test cases. Make sure at
least one is something the code doesn't do yet.
  Example (done): The dice should be able to show any of the 6 possible values.

What are your goals for improving the code? List at least three nontrivial
changes (that is, beyond changing what's in print statements). These should
include ensuring all your tests pass!
  Example (done): Invalid inputs for the "continue" prompt shouldn't throw an error.
